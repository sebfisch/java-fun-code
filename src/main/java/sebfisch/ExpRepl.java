   * TODO 3.4 Interactive evaluation
   * 
   * Implement an interactive evaluator of arithmetic expressions as command line
   * program.
   * Here is an example interaction:
   * 
   * Enter arithmetic expressions to evaluate them, press ^C to quit.
   * eval> 6*3 + 4
   * ((6 * 3) + 4) = 22
   * eval> 6 * (3+4)
   * (6 * (3 + 4)) = 42
   * eval> 5 % 2
   * parse error for: 5 % 2
   * eval> 1/0
   * (1 / 0) = undefined
   * eval> 50 - 50/6
   * (50 - (50 / 6)) = 42
   * eval> ^C
   * 
   * Use the lines method provided by BufferedReader to process inputs in a stream
   * pipeline.
   * Implement error handling for parse errors and division by zero as shown in
   * the example as well as for possible I/O exceptions.
